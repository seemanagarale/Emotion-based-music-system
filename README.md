# Emotion-based-music-system
Music plays a very important role in enhancing an individual’s life as it is an important medium of entertainment for music lovers and listeners.  In today’s world, with ever increasing advancements in the field of multimedia and technology, various music players have been developed with features like fast forward, reverse, variable playback speed (seek & time compression), local playback, streaming playback with multicast streams and including volume modulation, genre classification etc.  Although these features satisfy the user’s basic requirements, yet the user has to face the task of manually browsing through the playlist of songs and select songs based on his current mood and behaviour.  So this application comes up with an idea of playing the songs based on emotion of user by capturing the face image of the user.
  Here we are proposing Emotion based music player which will play songs according to the emotion of the user.  It aims to provide user-preferred music with emotion awareness. This player is based on the idea of automating much of the interaction between the music player and its user.
